# DC-Tower-Elevator-Challenge
My Implementation of the IBM DC Tower Elevator Challenge

It should simulate the behaviour of the elevators in the highest building of Vienna.
This sample application is mainly based on ConcurrentLinkedQueue, Threads and Streams.
To test the program, run the main method in app/Main.java.
